            I <span className="highlight primary">care</span> about the business, people and clients.
            I don't know everything so I am exceptionally good at <span className="highlight primary">Googling</span>.
            I don't like dangling problems so I <span className="highlight primary">figure out solutions</span>.
            I am super eager to <span className="highlight primary">learn</span> technologies, methods, and techniques that are unfamiliar to me.
            I believe commuting takes up a lot of valuable time to both the business and myself so I prefer <span className="highlight primary">remote work</span>.
            I can <span className="highlight primary">handle realistic pressure</span> and I don't work excessive long hours.
            I know that I am not a super human so I <span className="highlight primary">work well in teams</span> and learn from colleagues.

            I am open to learning anything I am unfamiliar with and enjoy improving and mastering what I am currently acquainted with.
            I now have {new Date().getFullYear() - 2006} years of experience of software development and am thoroughly enjoying it.

              Since 2006, I have been developing web applications in .NET and Microsoft SQL Server using Microsoft Visual Studio.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2016, I was introduced to Agile and Git.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2018, I was introduced to <Anchor to="https://sulami.github.io/posts/why-i-like-clojure/">Clojure</Anchor>,
              ClojureScript and <Anchor to="https://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</Anchor> <span role="img" aria-label="Sparkling heart emoji" title="Absolutely love it">üíñ</span>

        <Panel title="How did I start web application development?">
          <p>
            Between computer games, the birth of the web, the movie Hackers, the Jolly Rodger's cookbook and an Inkjet printer, I was hooked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both my cousin and I were watching an Inkjet printer do it's thing.
            I was fascinated at how methodical and ingenious this device was to me.
            I asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up.
            I don't know what she said but I said "a programmer".
          </p>
          <p>
            I also remember having a Spectrum.
            Apart from the most awesome Space Invaders <span role="img" aria-label="Space Invaders emoji">üëæ</span>, there was a cartridge for learning how to program in BASIC.
            I enjoyed that too.
          </p>

        <Panel title="How did I learn to do what I do?">
          <p>
            I learned to take apart websites and put them back together again locally.
            I experimented with different mark up until I got the feel of how to make websites.
            I taught others about the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I had learned.
            I still take things apart and learn how to put them together.
            I do read more documentation now as it's easy to miss important things just by teaching one's self.
            I then studied Computer Science and Information Systems at CTI (Computer Training Institute) in 2004 and 2005 and passed both diplomas with distinctions. <span role="img" aria-label="Rocket emoji">üöÄ</span>
