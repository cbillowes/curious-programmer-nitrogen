            When I am, ask me to do a test at home or invite me to an informal interview over coffee. I am shy but I warm up and shine in time.
            I can handle realistic pressure. Working persistent long hours is not a job for me.
            I prefer remote work in Clojure, React or Gatsby.
            I use Spacemacs (Evil mode) and Visual Studio Code.
            I need a laptop, preferrably a MacBook Pro.

          <p>
            Between computer games, the Internet, the movie Hackers, the Jolly Rodger's cookbook and an Inkjet printer, I was hooked.
            Both my cousin and I were watching an Inkjet printer do it's thing.
            I was fascinated at how methodical and ingenius this device was to me.
            I asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up.
            I don't know what she said but I said "a programmer".
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember having a Spectrum.
            Apart from the most awesome Space Invaders <span role="img" aria-label="Space Invaders">ðŸ‘¾</span>, there was a cartridge for learning how to program in BASIC.
            I enjoyed that too.

          <p>
            I learned to take apart websites and put them back together again locally.
            I experimented with different mark up until I got the feel of how to make websites.
            I taught others about the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I had learned.
            I still take things apart and learn how to put them together.
            I do read more documentation now as it's easy to miss important things just by teaching one's self.
